# FrameClick

Welcome to the FrameClick! This web application is designed to replicate the popular Unsplash platform, allowing users to discover and explore a vast collection of high-quality, royalty-free images. Powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the FrameClick provides a seamless and intuitive experience for image browsing.

## Description

**Note**: This project is solely created for educational and personal practice purposes. It is not intended to compete with or replicate the functionality of the real Unsplash platform. The FrameClick is a demonstration of my web development skills and understanding of integrating APIs. All images used in this project are fetched from the Unsplash API for non-commercial use only.

## Technologies Used

The FrameClick web application is built using the following technologies:

* **HTML5**: The project utilizes HTML5 to structure the content and define the layout of the web page. HTML5 provides a semantic and well-organized structure for the application's elements and components.

* **CSS3**: CSS3 is used to add styles, visual enhancements, and responsive design to the FrameClick. It provides the flexibility to customize the appearance and layout of the application, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

* **JavaScript (JS)**: JavaScript is employed to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to the FrameClick. Through the use of JS, the application is able to handle user events, perform search operations, and display images from the Unsplash API in a seamless manner.

* **Unsplash API**: The FrameClick integrates the Unsplash API to fetch high-quality images from the Unsplash platform. By utilizing the API, the application is able to search for images, retrieve their metadata, and display them to the user.

I am continuously working to improve the functionality and performance of the FrameClick. The project is a work in progress, and I am constantly exploring new ways to enhance its features and capabilities.
